| The app enforces a minimum device-access-security policy, such as requiring the user to set a device passcode.                                                                                                      |

| App does not use cryptographic protocols or algorithms that are widely considered depreciated for security purposes.                                                                                                |

| Login Throttling (After a few unsuccessful login attempts, targeted accounts should be locked (temporarily or permanently))                                                                                         |
| Session IDs are randomly generated on the server side.                                                                                                                                                              |
| The IDs can't be guessed easily                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Session IDs are always exchanged over secure connections (e.g. HTTPS).                                                                                                                                              |
| The mobile app doesn't save session IDs in permanent storage.                                                                                                                                                       |
| The session is terminated on the server side and deleted within the mobile app after it times out or the user logs out.                                                                                             |
| Session Timeout (10mins - 2 hours)                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| If JWT is used - check JWT has been hashed                                                                                                                                                                          |
| If JWT is used - JWT (token) expiration                                                                                                                                                                             |
| User Logout and Session Timeouts (Repeat the request after logging out)                                                                                                                                             |
| OTP Auth (make sure the number is validated with a proper length)                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2FA test (in case we have it in the future)                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Network Communication**                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Verify that data is encrypted on the network using TLS. The secure channel is used consistently throughout the app.                                                                                                 |
| Verify that the app doesn't rely on a single insecure communication channel (email or SMS) for critical operations, such as enrollments and account recovery.                                                       |
| Platform Interaction                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Fragment Injection                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Verify that the app only requires the minimum set of permissions necessary.                                                                                                                                         |
| Verify that the app does not export sensitive functionality via custom URL schemes, unless these mechanisms are properly protected.                                                                                 |
| Verify that WebViews are configured to allow only the minimum set of protocol handlers required (ideally, only https). Potentially dangerous handlers, such as file, tel and app-id, are disabled.                  |
| Verify that object serialization, if any, is implemented using safe serialization APIs.                                                                                                                             |
| Verify that the app detects whether it is being executed on a rooted or jailbroken device. Depending on the business requirement, users are warned, or the app is terminated if the device is rooted or jailbroken. |
